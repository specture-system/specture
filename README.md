# 🏗️ Specture

> Spec-driven software architecture system

## 🚧 Coming Soon

Specture is a spec-driven software architecture and project management system designed for small teams working with AI agents.

### The Concept

- **Specs for Planned Changes**: New features, major refactors, redesigns, and tooling improvements are added as markdown files in `specs/`, with discussion happening in the pull request that adds the spec
- **Issues for Bugs Only**: The issue tracker is for bugs - cases where the software doesn't match what's described in the specs
- **AI-Friendly Workflow**: Designed to work seamlessly with AI agents that help build and maintain your codebase
- **Small Team Focus**: Built for teams where lightweight, document-driven planning makes sense

### Status

This project is in early stages. Documentation and tooling coming soon.

**Note**: Issues are for bugs only. For features, refactors, or other changes, submit a pull request adding a spec file to `specs/`.
