## Specture System

This project uses the [Specture System](https://github.com/specture-system/specture) for managing specs. See the `.skills/specture/` skill for the full workflow, or run `specture help` for CLI usage.

Add this section to {{if .IsClaudeFile}}CLAUDE.md{{else}}AGENTS.md{{end}} so agents are aware of the system. Overwrite any existing section about Specture.
