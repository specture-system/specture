# Specs

Specs are design documents that describe planned changes to this project. Each spec file (`specs/NNN-name.md`) contains the design rationale, decisions, and a task list for implementation.

For full documentation on the spec system, workflow, and file format, see the [Specture System](https://github.com/specture-system/specture) repository. Run `specture help` for CLI usage.

This project uses {{.ContributionType}}s for collaboration on specs.
