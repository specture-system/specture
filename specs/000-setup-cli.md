# Implement Setup CLI

## Description

Implement a basic CLI tool to make it convenient to add the Specture System to any git repository. The script will be written in Go and prompt the user for configuration options like git forge.

This tool will streamline the onboarding process for teams wanting to adopt the Specture System, automating the creation of necessary directories, documentation, and configuration files. By providing an interactive setup experience, we reduce friction and ensure consistent implementation across different projects.

The CLI will handle platform-specific considerations (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, etc.) and guide users through initial configuration decisions, making it easy to get started with spec-driven development.
