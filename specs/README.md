# Specs

Specs are design documents that describe planned changes to this project. Each spec file in `specs/` contains the design rationale, decisions, and a task list for implementation. Spec numbers are stored in the YAML frontmatter `number` field. Filenames are slugs (e.g., `status-command.md`).

For full documentation on the spec system, workflow, and file format, see the [Specture System](https://github.com/specture-system/specture) repository. Run `specture help` for CLI usage.

This project uses pull requests for collaboration on specs.
