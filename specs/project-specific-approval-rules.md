# Project-Specific Approval Rules Integration

Currently, the Specture System states that approval criteria are project-specific but provides no mechanism for projects to formally define or enforce their own approval rules.

We need to come up with some mechanism for allowing projects to document their project-specific approval rules.

See [this thread](https://github.com/mrs-electronics-inc/android-automotive/pull/2#discussion_r2632381243) for some ideas.

## Task List

Tasks will be added once the design is finalized.
